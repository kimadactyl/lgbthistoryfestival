            <p>Emily Crompton leads a heritage walking trail mapping the political, economic and social background of how Manchester built Europe’s first Gay Centre.</p>
            
            <p>This 2 hour walking tour will follow the story of how Manchester became one of the first places to have an entirely publicly funded, purpose built centre for the gay community. We will follow the money, as it were, from the Town Hall to Canal Street and then to Sidney Street and one of the city’s most diverse urban blocks, home to an evangelical church and conference centre, a plethora of fast-food takeaways, Manchester’s Islamic Centre, a vegan wholefoods cooperative and the LGBT Centre!</p>
            
            <p>The story is one of unlikely success in the face of public funding cuts, some hostile political foes and an infamous 140 signature petition. It is also one which perfectly shows the change in public sector funding from the 80s to the present day. Above all, it is a heartening story of community spirit and perseverance. We will also look forward to the future of the LGBT Centre.</p>
            
            <ul>
              <li>Start: Manchester Town Hall main entrance, Albert Square</li>
              <li>Finish: Sidney Street Café with tea and cake</li>
              <li>Time: Meet 1:45pm for a 2pm start</li>

            <p>Peter Tatchell tells the inside story of how Dr Vaernet was authorised by the head of the Gestapo to experiment on gay concentration camp prisoners to discover a medical means to eradicate homosexuality - and how he escaped prosecution for war crimes with the collusion of Danish and British governments. </p>
            
            <p>Peter Tatchell has campaigned for LGBT and other human rights since 1967. A pioneer of the London Gay Liberation Front in 1971, he staged the first gay rights protest in a communist country (East Germany, 1973). He was the defeated Labour candidate in the 1983 Bermondsey by-election – the dirtiest, most homophobic and violent election in Britain for 100 years.</p>
            
            <p>In 1989, he helped found the AIDS activist group ACT UP London, and in 1990 he was a founding member of the LGBT direct action organisation OutRage! </p>
            
            <p>He outed 10 anti-gay bishops in 1994; twice attempted a citizen’s arrest of the Zimbabwean dictator Robert Mugabe (1999 and 2001); interrupted the 1998 Easter Sermon of the then anti-equality Archbishop of Canterbury, George Carey; ambushed Tony Blair’s motorcade in protest at the Iraq war (2003); and was beaten by neo-Nazis at the banned Moscow Pride parade in 2007.</p>
            
            <p>His inspirations are Mahatma Gandhi, Sylvia Pankhurst, Martin Luther King and Malcolm X. For more info about Peter’s human rights campaigns and to make a donation: <a href="www.PeterTatchellFoundation.org">Peter Tatchell Foundation</a></p>

            <p>Peter Scott-Presland will read from his forthcoming book, <em>Amiable Warriors</em>. </p>
            
            <p>The Campaign for Homosexual Equality between 1967 and 1973 developed a unique approach to the emancipation of homosexuals. The reason for prejudice was ignorance, and ignorance would only be dispelled if heterosexual members of society came to know some real-life homosexuals.  So it was important for people to start coming out.  But they would never be able to do that until they had discovered some self-awareness and self-confidence. In order to do that, they needed, in the words of the title of Volume 1 of Amiable Warriors, A Space to Breathe.  Somewhere they could explore what it meant to be gay, and to gain the acceptance and support of other homosexuals.  Initially this was going to be through Esquire Clubs, but when these proved difficult to get off the ground, the focus moved to the idea that any group of gay people can carry around its own ‘gay space’, and local CHE groups were formed across the country - over 100 in total.  The readings will focus on aspects of creating this ‘gay space’: firstly, a brief account of trying to get a club off the ground in Burnley; and then the antecedents of local groups - Albany Trust discussion groups 1964-67 in London, and heterosexual singles clubs around the country.  Followed by questions from the audience.</p>
            
            <p>For forty years Peter Scott-Presland has been involved in the LGBT rights movement, as campaigner, journalist, playwright and entertainer (‘the Vera Lynn of the homosexual community’, as he was described in 1982). The founder director of first Consenting Adults (1979-86) and then Homo Promos (1988 - present) Theatre Companies, highlights of his theatrical career include a series of Heath Plays (1981-85) designed to be performed at midnight on Midsummer Night near the Hampstead Heath cruising ground, the controversial ‘Leather’, which a brewery tried to ban from its pub theatre (Finborough Arms, 1989); and the musical ‘La Ronde’, nominated for Best Musical 2012 in the off-West End awards.As a journalist he worked for Gay News, Gay Times, Axiom and above all Capital Gay (1981-88) where he won a reputation as a savagely funny columnist and reviewer of the contemporary gay scene, as well as being a reporter.  He is currently writing lyrics for the band ‘Matyas and the Hybrid Mind’.</p>
            
            <p>He was commissioned in 2010 to write the ‘official’ history of the Campaign for Homosexual Equality.  Though lacking formal qualifications as a historian - he has an MA and BLitt from Oxford in English - he does have the advantage of knowing some of the people who were involved in the story he is describing.  He has an insider’s view of what it was like to set up and run campaigns in the 1970s and 80s;  and his journalistic abilities can animate a unique story which has not to this day been told.</p>

            <p>Emily Crompton leads a heritage walking trail mapping the political, economic and social background of how Manchester built Europe’s first Gay Centre.</p>
            
            <p>This 2 hour walking tour will follow the story of how Manchester became one of the first places to have an entirely publicly funded, purpose built centre for the gay community. We will follow the money, as it were, from the Town Hall to Canal Street and then to Sidney Street and one of the city’s most diverse urban blocks, home to an evangelical church and conference centre, a plethora of fast-food takeaways, Manchester’s Islamic Centre, a vegan wholefoods cooperative and the LGBT Centre!</p>
            
            <p>The story is one of unlikely success in the face of public funding cuts, some hostile political foes and an infamous 140 signature petition. It is also one which perfectly shows the change in public sector funding from the 80s to the present day. Above all, it is a heartening story of community spirit and perseverance. We will also look forward to the future of the LGBT Centre.</p>
            
            <ul>
              <li>Start: Manchester Town Hall main entrance, Albert Square</li>
              <li>Finish: Sidney Street Café with tea and cake</li>
              <li>Time: Meet 1:45pm for a 2pm start</li>

            <p>Rose Bush will share some of her riotous past with us in a presentation of this ongoing oral history project. </p>
            
            <p>This talk will be a mixture of audio interviews, photographs and films of the period. </p>
            
            <p>Before there were queer activists, before there were Riot Grrls there were the Rebel Dykes of London. We were young, we were feminists, we were anarchists, we were punks. We lived together in squats in Hackney and Brixton and at Greenham Camp (Green and Blue gates only). We went to political demos every Saturday, we created squatted crèches and bookshops and Wild Women Weekends (a forerunner of Ladyfests), feminist newspapers, like Feminaxe and magazines such as Shocking Pink. We had bands like Poison Girls and Well Oiled Sisters. We ran sex positive Lesbian S/M clubs such as Chain Reactions, we were trans friendly, we worked in the sex industry. We talked politics. We fought, we made up, we created and we loved. </p>
            
            <p>Rose Bush is Manchester based promoter of queer events and she works as a nurse. Over the past 5 years in Manchester she has been involved with Ladyfests, Queerchester, Queer We Are and The Riot Collective. She’s going to be aged 50 very soon, and before living in Manchester she has moved around every few years, living in amongst other places, San Francisco, London, Berlin, Glasgow and Todmorden, always finding some feminist or queer project or other to inspire her.</p>

            <p>Helena gained a degree, as a mature student, in Politics, Literature and the History of Ideas from Bradford University followed by a Post-graduate Certificate of Education under the auspices of Leeds University. Since 1983 she has been studying and editing the Journals of Anne Lister. Her first publication was I Know my Own Heart, published by Virago Press in 1988. In 2010 Virago published a revised and expanded version under the title The Secret Diaries of Miss Anne Lister, following the film of the same name which BBC2 made in that year. A second book of extracts, No Priest But Love, was published by New York University Press in 1992. Since her retirement from teaching Helena has been working on a biography of Anne Lister.</p>

            <p>Razia Aziz – During a half century which has taken me from Lagos to London to Brighton to Lewes, from a girls’ public school to Cambridge to company director, from an Indian Muslim heritage to the mixed blessings of the distinctive UK brand of 21st century diversity, from an ambition to be a professional singer to body work practitioner to Interfaith Ministry, I have often pondered upon the meaning and significance of my gender identity and sexuality in pursuit of an answer to the question we all ask at some point in our life: “What’s it all for?”</p>
            
            <p>The world continues to turn, and attitudes towards gender, sex and sexuality have undergone a sea change since my own adolescence in the race-and-class-conscious south London of the 1970s. My personal thread of a journey has woven itself both because, and in spite, of these epoch-making changes.</p>
            
            <p>All the while, Spirit remains luminous and unchanging, though my unfolding relationship to It is the constant and compelling source &amp; destination of my life quest.</p>

            <p>In her talk Laila El-Metoui will share her experience of managing LGBT projects and initiatives within the Further Education sector. </p>
            
            <p>Laila is a highly enthusiastic and dedicated education specialist with 20 years’ experience in Further Education.  An extremely well organised manager with a teaching background in ESOL and EFL, she currently chairs NATECLA London as a volunteer, providing a range of CPD and networking opportunities for its members. </p>
            
            <p>Last year she co-ordinated Educate Out Prejudice at Morley College, London, a project which offered practical solutions to support the inclusion of LGBT themes into the adult ESOL curriculum. It investigated and consulted on issues relating to the content of enrolment forms and data collection of sexual orientation and gender identities through a pilot with a range of ESOL (and other) classes; and offered practical support, including training and teaching resources for themes which can be challenging for learners and staff from diverse cultural backgrounds. Summary of the project can be found here <a href="http://www.equalitiestoolkit.com/content/educate-out-prejudice">Educate Out Prejudice</a> </p>
            
            <p>This is year she is managing The humane selfie: ‘Life gets better together’ at Working Men’s College, London, a project which aims to bring students and staff together in purposeful, mutually beneficial activities, to promote greater understanding and respect between various protected characteristics. While the project considers all protected characteristics, there will be greater emphasis on sexual orientation, gender identity, and religion and belief. Further details about the project can be found on this link <a href="http://www.ecu.ac.uk/goodpracticefund/funded-projects/working-mens-college/">The Humane Selfie: Life Gets Better Together</a> </p>
            
            <p>Laila hosts a bi-monthly radio programme on <a href="http://www.reelrebelsradio.com/archives/outtakes/">Reel Rebel Radio</a>. OUTtakes, the tracks of my life, raises positive awareness of the LGBTiQ population in the UK. It aims to ‘usualise’ this often invisible community through an interview, music and chats. It hopes to further support the establishing of the LGBTiQ population as also being normative. She invites a different LGBTIQ person who is interviewed through the tracks of their lives. Guests select music which has a specific significance to them and chats to them about their lives. #OUTtakesradio</p>
            
            <p>She is the Founder and Director of <a href="www.lelmeducation.com">LelmEducation</a> a consultation and training organisation supporting the Further Education sector with staff development training and consultancy on Equality and Diversity with a particular emphasis on LGBT. </p>

            <p>Sheila Standard remembers where she was in 1979 when it was announced on the radio that First Strike, American Cruise Nuclear missiles were to be based at Greenham Common USAF Airbase. Like most people she was gripped with fear and a sense of inevitable disaster, and felt powerless to do anything. The worst bit was her mum lived near Greenham, and would ‘get it first!’ However, the feeling of powerlessness did not last for long. All over the country people started to organise into anti missile groups, and she joined Withington Against the Missiles, a local group in Manchester, and accidentally got involved in an NVDA (Non Violent Direct Action) protest becoming one of the “Bunker 4”. </p>
            
            <p>Then something truly epic happened… Greenham. </p>
            
            <p>This is a very personal reflection of one of thousands of women discovering the power of working together, singing, being silly, the wit and repartee, fear and bravery, that goes with bringing fences crashing down, to the mockery of militarism. </p>
            
            <p>A women’s movement that conflicted and then embraced sexuality, and stood up to the hateful press, and “respectable society”, embracing freedom, and our right to struggle against the holocaust. </p>
            
            <p>It is also a story of how women all over the country embraced Greenham and supported the Greenham Women’s Camps, and some of the triumphs and also low ebbs of this anarchic protest. </p>

            <p>In the early 1800s there was a vibrant social and sexual scene for men which revolved around the house of Isaac Hitchen in Great Sankey near Warrington. Meeting places like this were known as ‘molly’ houses in the parlance of the day. In May of 1806 a large group of the men were arrested following a raid on the house. Some escaped, but many of them were charged with ‘sodomy’ or an ‘unnatural crime,’ which in England carried the death penalty from the 1530s until 1861. In September of 1806, five of the men, including Hitchen himself, were sentenced to death by hanging. There is a Preston based LGBT community project named in his memory. </p>
            
            <p>“Isaac Hitchen’s House” tells the story of these men, the investigation, and the attitudes of the authorities, in song. Written and performed by Eleanor Levin, Nina George and Scott Millington of the Grievous Angels as part of Lancaster’s ‘Documenting Dissent’ project led by Global Link with grateful acknowledgement to Harry Cocks, Richard Norton and the Lancashire Archives.</p>
            
            <p>Eleanor, Nina and Scott’s first musical foray together was in 2005 as part of ‘The Mistresses of the Ten Minute Musical’ and led them to be instrumental in the foundation of the Grievous Angels, a solidarity-folk collective which was based in Lancaster. They are currently working on a project of songs based on Lancaster’s local history, and developing their own original works.  </p>

            <p>Peter Tatchell looks at the relationship between racism &amp; heterosexism in the colonial era and the on-going impact of Britain’s exported homophobia worldwide. </p>
            
            <p>Peter Tatchell has campaigned for LGBT and other human rights since 1967. A pioneer of the London Gay Liberation Front in 1971, he staged the first gay rights protest in a communist country (East Germany, 1973). He was the defeated Labour candidate in the 1983 Bermondsey by-election – the dirtiest, most homophobic and violent election in Britain for 100 years.</p>
            
            <p>In 1989, he helped found the AIDS activist group ACT UP London, and in 1990 he was a founding member of the LGBT direct action organisation OutRage! </p>
            
            <p>He outed 10 anti-gay bishops in 1994; twice attempted a citizen’s arrest of the Zimbabwean dictator Robert Mugabe (1999 and 2001); interrupted the 1998 Easter Sermon of the then anti-equality Archbishop of Canterbury, George Carey; ambushed Tony Blair’s motorcade in protest at the Iraq war (2003); and was beaten by neo-Nazis at the banned Moscow Pride parade in 2007.</p>
            
            <p>His inspirations are Mahatma Gandhi, Sylvia Pankhurst, Martin Luther King and Malcolm X. For more info about Peter’s human rights campaigns and to make a donation:

            <p>Some of the best LGBT stories from forty years of organising in UNISON, the public service union, and its predecessor unions.  The pitched battle on the letters page of the union magazine in 1974. How ten years later, 70 lesbian and gay union members were accused of running a brothel. Why in the early 90s we negotiated a right of reply for Black lesbians and gay men in The Voice newspaper.  Why we were slated on the pages of Bi Community News and what happened next.  How one woman found her voice during a rules debate.  All this and more.  The moral of the story?  We are stronger together!</p>

            <p>At the age of twenty-six, in 1896, Eva Gore-Booth was sent to recover from illness in the picturesque village of Bordighera in Italy. In the garden, standing under an olive tree, she first met a young English woman, Esther Roper. The encounter was to change the two women’s lives forever.  </p>
            
            <p>Eva Gore-Booth was the daughter of an Anglo-Irish landlord who owned one of the largest estates in the West of Ireland. In stark contrast, Esther Roper was from working class stock. Within months of her return to Ireland, Eva made an extraordinary decision in order to be with Esther. In 1897, she rejected her aristocratic lifestyle, moving from an opulent mansion in the beautiful countryside of Sligo to a mid-terrace property in the smog-bound quarters of industrial Manchester.</p>
            
            <p>This talk examines the remarkable thirty-year relationship of Eva and Esther. Once labelled as a pair of oddities, it is now clear that the women were open about their relationship, mixing with an eclectic group of radical gay and lesbian activists. The couple became formidable political advocates in England often organising successful and radical campaigns for social justice. Using recently uncovered letters, diaries and manuscripts, this story is a fascinating account of two women who refused to comply with the norms of society at the turn of the twentieth century.</p>
            
            <p>Dr Sonja Tiernan is a Lecturer in Modern History at Liverpool Hope University. She has published widely in the area of LGBT history including two volumes on the histories of sexuality. Her most recent publications include Eva Gore-Booth: an Image of Such Politics (2012) and The Political Writings of Eva Gore-Booth due for publication in 2015. Sonja is currently writing the official history of the Marriage Equality campaign in Ireland to be published later this year.  </p>

            <p>‘All The Nice Girls’ by <a href="http://www.behindthelines.info/">Behind The Lines</a> takes an entertaining glimpse at the lives of Gwen Farrar and Norah Blaney through the eyes of male impersonator Ella Shields. Starting out in Lena Ashwell’s concert parties for the troops in WW1 the young Farrar and Blaney quickly adapted their classical ‘cello/piano act into a ‘turn’ full of repartee and physical humour.</p>
            
            <p>Household names in the early 1920s, Farrar and Blaney had an on and offstage partnership, singing popular love songs of the day to each other in West End Revues and living together openly. Atthe same time Ella Shields’ Music Hall act was in decline. ‘All The Nice Girls’ imagines her fictitious reaction to the younger pair as they live the starry life of Bright Young Things. Will their relationship survive the pressures of the age and the conflicting urges to marry and conform or to party wildly into oblivion?</p>

            <p>Many LGBT people like myself (Prossy Kakooza) run from persecution to seek asylum in nations like the UK thinking they’ll immediately be safe. But most times seeking asylum makes you enter what feels like another form of persecution with having to prove your sexuality to the immigration system. When I asked for asylum, on many levels, it felt like jumping from a frying pan into a fire. In a series of such intrusive and embarrassing questions, I was asked to prove I was gay. How on earth was I or anybody else supposed to do that?!</p>

            <p>The UK’s oldest extant bisexual organisation, BiPhoria, is based in Manchester.  Its existence has been at times both thanks to, and despite, the wider LGBT scene and culture in the city - giving Manchester a reputation as both a centre of bisexual community and of biphobia. Bi Community News editor Jen Yockney explores the group’s story, in the context of Manchester’s sometimes LGbt culture, and the wider bi movement in the UK since 1981.</p>
            
            <p>Jen Yockney is one of the most prominent bisexual activists in the UK, having worked on giving bi communities support and voice for the past twenty years. She works across many levels: frontline support at the UK’s oldest bisexual support group; publications and policy-making; and as a mentor reaching out to new volunteers to help bi groups and projects around the country blossom. </p>

            <p>Linda Bellos will be providing a personal account of some of her historic achievements over the years. She has been actively involved in community politics since the mid 1970’s. She came out as a lesbian and became a feminist in the late 1970’s. She joined the Spare Rib Collective in 1981 and demanded that lesbians be encouraged to be out. In the following years she helped organised the first Black Feminist and the First Black Lesbian Conferences. She argued strongly against the notion of a ‘hierarchy of oppression. In 1987, as Chair of the London Strategic Policy Unit, she was responsible for introducing Black History Month to the UK. 
            She has become a leading authority on equality and human rights law and its practical application across the public sector. Chair of the Institute of Equality and Diversity Practitioners, she also runs Linda Bellos Associates. Linda was awarded an OBE for her services to diversity in the 2007 New Year’s Honours List. 
            Linda is a regular guest contributor on national radio and television programmes, speaking mainly on current equality and diversity issues. She is a published author who has written many essays and letters on equality and diversity topics.</p>

            <p>The group took part in marches and actions throughout the year of the strike, making alliances with sacked strikers and other support groups. They produced regular bulletins, badges and posters, and monitored virulently anti-gay articles of the Sun. The presentation will discuss LGSP members’ connections and involvement with the strikers and print unions, including actions and interventions during the strike.</p>

            <p>About Manchester Lesbian and Gay Chorus</p>
            
            <p>Manchester Lesbian and Gay Chorus (MLGC) was founded in 2000 and is the city’s only LGBT community choir. With more than 80 members, it is one of the biggest LGBT choirs in the country. </p>
            
            <p>We are a community choir and welcome LGBT people with a diverse range of skills and abilities. We meet to rehearse, socialise, to give concerts and to perform at a range of events, including civil partnerships and events promoted by other LGBT community groups and affiliated organisations.</p>
            
            <p>To this end we employ a professional choral teacher as our musical director and strive to the highest quality of music-making that we can achieve.</p>
            
            <p>You may have heard or read about MLGC from the Safe to Sing event in November 2014, where several other North West choirs joined with them in Piccadilly Gardens to sing along in solidarity after they had sung on the Metrolink tram system as a form of protest. </p>
            
            <p>This action was prompted by homophobic attacks on two young gay men which had taken place on the city centre tram network. The men had been singing songs from the musical “Wicked”. This event was nationally and internationally supported around the world.</p>

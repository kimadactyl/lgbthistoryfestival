            <p>Saturday explores three centuries of LGBTQ identity, from when George III was on the throne to the present day. Campaigners and academics behind groups such as the Campaign for Homosexual Equality, the Lesbian Information Service, and Press for Change discuss their life work, legacy, successes, and regrets.</p>

              <p>A celebration of the remarkable work of LGBTQ campaigners living today. Highlights include the launch of The Campaign for Homosexual Equality's history, written by <strong>Peter Scott-Presland</strong>, while <strong>Ross Burgess</strong> talks about CHE's impact and legacy. <strong>Christine Burns MBE</strong>, key activist in Press For Change, whose work contributed to the Gender Recognition Act 2004, will talk about overcoming the challenges to document trans* history.</p>
              
              <p>We also talk to the people behind the frontline services that improved the lives of many, such as Nottinghamshire Lesbian and Gay Switchboard (presented by <strong>David Edgley</strong>) and the controversial Lesbian Information Service (presented by <strong>Jan Bridget</strong>). How do the people involved in these campaigns and services feel about their legacy today?</p>
              
              <p>Many other remarkable individuals will discuss their extraordinary lives, including <strong>Peter Tatchell</strong>, founder of the Gay Liberation Front; and <strong>Alex Herrmann</strong>, who will talk about his life as a gay man in Socialist East Germany.</p>
              
              <p>Obviously as a Manchester festival we have to talk about music! <strong>Abigail Ward</strong>, founder of the Manchester District Music Archive discusses her Queer Noise collection of tickets and posters, including infamous clubnights from Flesh (at the famous Haçienda) to Club Brenda.</p>

              <p><strong>Helena Whitbread</strong> discusses <strong>Anne Lister's</strong> (1791–1840) coded diaries, which detail her scandalous liaisons with women. Between 1806 and 1840 she wrote prolifically, with a total output of 26 volumes containing 4 million words. As well as writing about her sex life and seduction techniques, she wrote about the weather, social and national events, and her own business interests as a wealthy landowner.</p>
              
              <p>Oscar Wilde's lover, Lord Alfred ‘Bosie’ Douglas was married to <strong>Olive Custance</strong>, a remarkable person in her own right. <strong>Dr Sarah Parker</strong> will discuss her new research about Olive's relationships with both men and women, and her life as a successful poet.</p>

            <p>Organised protest and social movements have been instrumental in building a more equal world. Sunday focusses on the impact of power, institutions, and the law, in changing rights for LGBT people.</p>
            
            <p>We examine the global export of Britain's anti-gay buggery laws from the 19th century. We ask why lesbian voices have been marginalised in the protest movement, highlighting the remarkable work of women at Greenham Common Peace Camp. Finally, we chronicle campaigns against workplace discrimination beginning in the 1960s.</p>

            (Manchester Evening News, September 1880)</em></p>
            
            <p><strong>A Very Victorian Scandal</strong> (<a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/AVVS">#AVVS</a>) is a groundbreaking immersive theatre project, being performed over the festival weekend. The project will recreate scenes from the biggest police raid on an ‘LGBT’ event in British history. Manchester’s famous Victorian detective, <strong>Jerome Caminada</strong>, led the raid on an all-male fancy dress ball in Hulme, and arrested forty-seven men. The subsequent press coverage caused an international sensation. <strong>This was the UK’s Stonewall moment</strong>, and it happened in 1880.</p>

            <p>On Saturday and Sunday, <strong>Schools OUT UK</strong> will host the Schools &amp; Families festival strand. We will offer children, educators, parents and governors the chance to experience educational, fun, and inclusive activities for children of all ages.</p>
            
            <p>At Schools OUT, we are proud of our 40 year legacy making schools safer and more equal for lesbian, gay, bisexual and trans* people, in all their diversity. We are run entirely by volunteers, and established both LGBT History Month and The First National Festival of LGBT History to further our aims as national educators.</p>

              <p>Schools OUT believe that to eliminate the prejudice and negative stereotypes around minority groups and women, we need to educate out prejudice.</p>
              
              <p>All public organisations (including schools) have a duty under the <a href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2010/15/contents">Equality Act 2010</a> to not only prohibit discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity, but to actively educate people about all the protected characteristics, including gender, sexuality and marital status.</p>
              
              <p>These lessons will demonstrate how this can be done, and prove that such work can be fun, educational, and successful in eliminating discrimination.</p>

            </h3>
            <p>The LGF hosts &ldquo;The 2nd What is &amp; How to DO LGBT History?&rdquo; conference, which seeks to place attitudes, experiences and identities in their historical context.</p>
            
            <p>Despite the increasing popular demand for "LGBT History" in Britain, the history of attitudes towards sex and gender diversity in the UK remains an underdeveloped field, especially in comparison with the advances that have been made in the United States. An important part of the 10th anniversary celebrations of LGBT History month is to lead and develop the growing discourse into past attitudes towards sex and gender diversity within the academy and among the general public.</p>

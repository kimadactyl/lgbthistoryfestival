DESCRIPTION:{Emily Crompton} leads a heritage walking trail mapping the pol
 itical\, economic and social background of how Manchester built Europe’s fi
 rst Gay Centre.\n \nThis 2 hour walking tour will follow the story of how M
 anchester became one of the first places to have an entirely publicly funde
 d\, purpose built centre for the gay community. We will follow the money\, 
 as it were\, from the Town Hall to Canal Street and then to Sidney Street a
 nd one of the city’s most diverse urban blocks\, home to an evangelical chu
 rch and conference centre\, a plethora of fast-food takeaways\, Manchester’
 s Islamic Centre\, a vegan wholefoods cooperative and the LGBT Centre!\n \n
 The story is one of unlikely success in the face of public funding cuts\, s
 ome hostile political foes and an infamous 140 signature petition. It is al
 so one which perfectly shows the change in public sector funding from the 8
 0s to the present day. Above all\, it is a heartening story of community sp
 irit and perseverance. We will also look forward to the future of the LGBT 
 Centre.\n \n * Start: Manchester Town Hall main entrance\, Albert Square\n 
 * Finish: Sidney Street Café with tea and cake\n * Time: Meet 1:45pm for a 
 2pm start\n * Contact: Emily Crompton\, Architect at URBED\, 0161 200 5500

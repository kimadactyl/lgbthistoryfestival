DESCRIPTION:In the early 1800s there was a vibrant social and sexual scene 
 for men which revolved around the house of Isaac Hitchen in Great Sankey ne
 ar Warrington. Meeting places like this were known as ‘molly’ houses in the
  parlance of the day. In May of 1806 a large group of the men were arrested
  following a raid on the house. Some escaped\, but many of them were charge
 d with ‘sodomy’ or an ‘unnatural crime\,’ which in England carried the deat
 h penalty from the 1530s until 1861. In September of 1806\, five of the men
 \, including Hitchen himself\, were sentenced to death by hanging. There is
  a Preston based LGBT community project named in his memory. \n\n"Isaac Hit
 chen's House" tells the story of these men\, the investigation\, and the at
 titudes of the authorities\, in song. Written and performed by {Eleanor Lev
 in}\, {Nina George} and {Scott Millington} of the Grievous Angels as part o
 f Lancaster's 'Documenting Dissent' project led by Global Link with gratefu
 l acknowledgement to Harry Cocks\, Richard Norton and the Lancashire Archiv
 es.\n \nEleanor\, Nina and Scott’s first musical foray together was in 2005
  as part of ‘The Mistresses of the Ten Minute Musical’ and led them to be i
 nstrumental in the foundation of the Grievous Angels\, a solidarity-folk co
 llective which was based in Lancaster. They are currently working on a proj
 ect of songs based on Lancaster’s local history\, and developing their own 
 original works.  \n\n[Website of the song](http://www.documentingdissent.or

DESCRIPTION:‘All The Nice Girls’ by [Behind The Lines](http://www.behindthe
 lines.info/) takes an entertaining glimpse at the lives of Gwen Farrar and 
 Norah Blaney through the eyes of male impersonator Ella Shields. Starting o
 ut in Lena Ashwell’s concert parties for the troops in WW1 the young Farrar
  and Blaney quickly adapted their classical ‘cello/piano act into a ‘turn’ 
 full of repartee and physical humour.\n\nHousehold names in the early 1920s
 \, Farrar and Blaney had an on and offstage partnership\, singing popular l
 ove songs of the day to each other in West End Revues and living together o
 penly. Atthe same time Ella Shields’ Music Hall act was in decline. ‘All Th
 e Nice Girls’ imagines her fictitious reaction to the younger pair as they 
 live the starry life of Bright Young Things. Will their relationship surviv
 e the pressures of the age and the conflicting urges to marry and conform o
 r to party wildly into oblivion?\n\n{Ali Child} is a writer\, director and 
 performer. She was a Choral Exhibitioner at Trinity College\, Cambridge\, a
 ppeared at the Arts Theatre with the Marlowe Society and Cambridge Universi
 ty Opera Society and  toured for two years with the Footlights Revue. She g
 raduated with a degree in History and a P.G.C.E. in English and Drama.\n\n{
 Rosie Wakley} has worked in the theatre in many capacities including Master
  Carpenter\, Stage Manager and ultimately Production Manager at the Coliseu
 m for the English National Opera. She has an M.B.A. degree from Lancaster U
 niversity and performs widely as her alter ego\, lounge singer\, Ronnie Ria
 lto.\n\n[Kindly sponsored by Foale Consulting Ltd.](http://www.initiative-c

DESCRIPTION:‘All The Nice Girls’ by [Behind The Lines](http://www.behindthe
 lines.info/) takes an entertaining glimpse at the lives of Gwen Farrar and 
 Norah Blaney through the eyes of male impersonator Ella Shields. Starting o
 ut in Lena Ashwell’s concert parties for the troops in WW1 the young Farrar
  and Blaney quickly adapted their classical ‘cello/piano act into a ‘turn’ 
 full of repartee and physical humour.\n\nHousehold names in the early 1920s
 \, Farrar and Blaney had an on and offstage partnership\, singing popular l
 ove songs of the day to each other in West End Revues and living together o
 penly. Atthe same time Ella Shields’ Music Hall act was in decline. ‘All Th
 e Nice Girls’ imagines her fictitious reaction to the younger pair as they 
 live the starry life of Bright Young Things. Will their relationship surviv
 e the pressures of the age and the conflicting urges to marry and conform o
 r to party wildly into oblivion?\n\n{Ali Child} is a writer\, director and 
 performer. She was a Choral Exhibitioner at Trinity College\, Cambridge\, a
 ppeared at the Arts Theatre with the Marlowe Society and Cambridge Universi
 ty Opera Society and  toured for two years with the Footlights Revue. She g
 raduated with a degree in History and a P.G.C.E. in English and Drama.\n\n{
 Rosie Wakley} has worked in the theatre in many capacities including Master
  Carpenter\, Stage Manager and ultimately Production Manager at the Coliseu
 m for the English National Opera. She has an M.B.A. degree from Lancaster U
 niversity and performs widely as her alter ego\, lounge singer\, Ronnie Ria
 lto.\n\n[Kindly sponsored by Foale Consulting Ltd.](http://www.initiative-c

 en and performed by {Eleanor Levin}\, {Nina George} and {Scott Millington}

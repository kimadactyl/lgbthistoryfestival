DESCRIPTION:A documentary about the man who brought us all out of the ‘Cell
 uloid Closet’. \n\nDirector Jeffrey Schwarz looks back at Russo’s life as a
  film fan\, a film critic and latterly as an AIDS activist. In the aftermat
 h of Stonewall (1969)\, Russo found his voice as an angry critic of LGBT re
 presentation in the media. Always defiant and eloquent\, this moving and in
 spiring film tells the story of one of our movement’s most important figure
 s. \n\nThe screening will be introduced by Dr {Andrew Moor} of Manchester M
 etropolitan University\, and there will be a post-screening discussion.\n\n

The world continues to turn, and attitudes towards gender, sex and sexuality have undergone a sea change since my own adolescence in the race-and-class-conscious south London of the 1970s. My personal thread of a journey has woven itself both because, and in spite, of these epoch-making changes.
 
All the while, Spirit remains luminous and unchanging, though my unfolding relationship to It is the constant and compelling source & destination of my life quest.

Since 1983 she has been studying and editing the Journals of Anne Lister. Her first publication was I Know my Own Heart, published by Virago Press in 1988. In 2010 Virago published a revised and expanded version under the title The Secret Diaries of Miss Anne Lister, following the film of the same name which BBC2 made in that year.

Peter Scott Presland: CHE Reading,2015-02-14 13:20:00 UTC,2015-02-14 13:50:00 UTC,2015-01-30 16:52:35 UTC,Space 3,"{Peter Scott-Presland} will read from his forthcoming book, {Amiable Warriors}. 

The Campaign for Homosexual Equality between 1967 and 1973 developed a unique approach to the emancipation of homosexuals. The reason for prejudice was ignorance, and ignorance would only be dispelled if heterosexual members of society came to know some real-life homosexuals.  So it was important for people to start coming out.  But they would never be able to do that until they had discovered some self-awareness and self-confidence. In order to do that, they needed, in the words of the title of Volume 1 of Amiable Warriors, A Space to Breathe.  Somewhere they could explore what it meant to be gay, and to gain the acceptance and support of other homosexuals.  Initially this was going to be through Esquire Clubs, but when these proved difficult to get off the ground, the focus moved to the idea that any group of gay people can carry around its own 'gay space', and local CHE groups were formed across the country - over 100 in total.  The readings will focus on aspects of creating this 'gay space': firstly, a brief account of trying to get a club off the ground in Burnley; and then the antecedents of local groups - Albany Trust discussion groups 1964-67 in London, and heterosexual singles clubs around the country.  Followed by questions from the audience.

For forty years {Peter Scott-Presland} has been involved in the LGBT rights movement, as campaigner, journalist, playwright and entertainer ('the Vera Lynn of the homosexual community', as he was described in 1982). The founder director of first Consenting Adults (1979-86) and then Homo Promos (1988 - present) Theatre Companies, highlights of his theatrical career include a series of Heath Plays (1981-85) designed to be performed at midnight on Midsummer Night near the Hampstead Heath cruising ground, the controversial 'Leather', which a brewery tried to ban from its pub theatre (Finborough Arms, 1989); and the musical 'La Ronde', nominated for Best Musical 2012 in the off-West End awards.As a journalist he worked for Gay News, Gay Times, Axiom and above all Capital Gay (1981-88) where he won a reputation as a savagely funny columnist and reviewer of the contemporary gay scene, as well as being a reporter.  He is currently writing lyrics for the band 'Matyas and the Hybrid Mind'.

He was commissioned in 2010 to write the 'official' history of the Campaign for Homosexual Equality.  Though lacking formal qualifications as a historian - he has an MA and BLitt from Oxford in English - he does have the advantage of knowing some of the people who were involved in the story he is describing.  He has an insider's view of what it was like to set up and run campaigns in the 1970s and 80s;  and his journalistic abilities can animate a unique story which has not to this day been told.

"Sonja Tiernan: ""Sappho was right"". The formidable relationship of Eva Gore-Booth and  Esther Roper",2015-02-15 14:00:00 UTC,2015-02-15 14:30:00 UTC,2015-01-30 16:52:35 UTC,Coal Store,"At the age of twenty-six, in 1896, Eva Gore-Booth was sent to recover from illness in the picturesque village of Bordighera in Italy. In the garden, standing under an olive tree, she first met a young English woman, Esther Roper. The encounter was to change the two women’s lives forever.  

Eva Gore-Booth was the daughter of an Anglo-Irish landlord who owned one of the largest estates in the West of Ireland. In stark contrast, Esther Roper was from working class stock. Within months of her return to Ireland, Eva made an extraordinary decision in order to be with Esther. In 1897, she rejected her aristocratic lifestyle, moving from an opulent mansion in the beautiful countryside of Sligo to a mid-terrace property in the smog-bound quarters of industrial Manchester.

This talk examines the remarkable thirty-year relationship of Eva and Esther. Once labelled as a pair of oddities, it is now clear that the women were open about their relationship, mixing with an eclectic group of radical gay and lesbian activists. The couple became formidable political advocates in England often organising successful and radical campaigns for social justice. Using recently uncovered letters, diaries and manuscripts, this story is a fascinating account of two women who refused to comply with the norms of society at the turn of the twentieth century.

Dr {Sonja Tiernan} is a Lecturer in Modern History at Liverpool Hope University. She has published widely in the area of LGBT history including two volumes on the histories of sexuality. Her most recent publications include Eva Gore-Booth: an Image of Such Politics (2012) and The Political Writings of Eva Gore-Booth due for publication in 2015. Sonja is currently writing the official history of the Marriage Equality campaign in Ireland to be published later this year.

Like most people she was gripped with fear and a sense of inevitable disaster, and felt powerless to do anything. The worst bit was her mum lived near Greenham, and would 'get it first!' However, the feeling of powerlessness did not last for long. All over the country people started to organise into anti missile groups, and she joined Withington Against the Missiles, a local group in Manchester, and accidentally got involved in an NVDA (Non Violent Direct Action) protest becoming one of the ""Bunker 4"". 

Then something truly epic happened... Greenham. 

This is a very personal reflection of one of thousands of women discovering the power of working together, singing, being silly, the wit and repartee, fear and bravery, that goes with bringing fences crashing down, to the mockery of militarism. 

A women's movement that conflicted and then embraced sexuality, and stood up to the hateful press, and ""respectable society"", embracing freedom, and our right to struggle against the holocaust. 

It is also a story of how women all over the country embraced Greenham and supported the Greenham Women's Camps, and some of the triumphs and also low ebbs of this anarchic protest.

Meeting places like this were known as ‘molly’ houses in the parlance of the day. In May of 1806 a large group of the men were arrested following a raid on the house. Some escaped, but many of them were charged with ‘sodomy’ or an ‘unnatural crime,’ which in England carried the death penalty from the 1530s until 1861. In September of 1806, five of the men, including Hitchen himself, were sentenced to death by hanging. There is a Preston based LGBT community project named in his memory. 

""Isaac Hitchen's House"" tells the story of these men, the investigation, and the attitudes of the authorities, in song. Written and performed by {Eleanor Levin}, {Nina George} and {Scott Millington} of the Grievous Angels as part of Lancaster's 'Documenting Dissent' project led by Global Link with grateful acknowledgement to Harry Cocks, Richard Norton and the Lancashire Archives.
 
Eleanor, Nina and Scott’s first musical foray together was in 2005 as part of ‘The Mistresses of the Ten Minute Musical’ and led them to be instrumental in the foundation of the Grievous Angels, a solidarity-folk collective which was based in Lancaster. They are currently working on a project of songs based on Lancaster’s local history, and developing their own original works.

All the Nice Girls,2015-02-15 14:00:00 UTC,2015-02-15 14:50:00 UTC,2015-01-30 16:52:36 UTC,Mini Theatre,"‘All The Nice Girls’ by [Behind The Lines](http://www.behindthelines.info/) takes an entertaining glimpse at the lives of Gwen Farrar and Norah Blaney through the eyes of male impersonator Ella Shields. Starting out in Lena Ashwell’s concert parties for the troops in WW1 the young Farrar and Blaney quickly adapted their classical ‘cello/piano act into a ‘turn’ full of repartee and physical humour.

Household names in the early 1920s, Farrar and Blaney had an on and offstage partnership, singing popular love songs of the day to each other in West End Revues and living together openly. Atthe same time Ella Shields’ Music Hall act was in decline. ‘All The Nice Girls’ imagines her fictitious reaction to the younger pair as they live the starry life of Bright Young Things. Will their relationship survive the pressures of the age and the conflicting urges to marry and conform or to party wildly into oblivion?

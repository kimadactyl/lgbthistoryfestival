DESCRIPTION:In the early 1800's there was a vibrant social and sexual scene
  for men which revolved around the house of Isaac Hitchen in Great Sankey n
 ear Warrington. Meeting places like this were known as ‘molly’ houses in th
 e parlance of the day. In May of 1806 a large group of the men were arreste
 d following a raid on the house. Some escaped\, but many of them were charg
 ed with ‘sodomy’ or an ‘unnatural crime\,’ which in England carried the dea
 th penalty from the 1530's until 1861. In September of 1806\, five of the m
 en\, including Hitchen himself\, were sentenced to death by hanging. There 
 is a Preston based LGBT community project named in his memory. \n\n"Isaac H
 itchen's House" tells the story of these men\, the investigation\, and the 
 attitudes of the authorities\, in song. Written and performed by Eleanor Le
 vin\, Nina George and Scott Millington of the Grievous Angels as part of La
 ncaster's 'Documenting Dissent' project led by Global Link with grateful ac
 knowledgement to Harry Cocks\, Richard Norton and the Lancashire Archives.\
 n \nEleanor\, Nina and Scott’s first musical foray together was in 2005 as 
 part of ‘The Mistresses of the Ten Minute Musical’ and led them to be instr
 umental in the foundation of the Grievous Angels\, a solidarity-folk collec

 of songs based on Lancaster’s local history\, and developing their own orig
 inal works.  \n\n[Website address of the song](http://www.documentingdissen

DESCRIPTION:Sheila Standard remembers where she was in 1979 when it was ann
 ounced on the radio that First Strike\, American Cruise Nuclear missiles we
 re to be based at Greenham Common USAF Airbase. Like most people she was gr
 ipped with fear and a sense of inevitable disaster\, and felt powerless to 
 do anything. The worst bit was her mum lived near Greenham\, and would 'get
  it first!' However\, the feeling of powerlessness did not last for long. A
 ll over the country people started to organise into anti missile groups\, a
 nd she joined Withington Against the Missiles\, a local group in Manchester
 \, and accidentally got involved in an NVDA(Non Violent Direct Action) prot
 est becoming one of the "Bunker 4". \n\nThen something truely epic happened
 .... Greenham. \nThis is a very personal reflection of one of thousands of 
 women discovering the power of working together\, singing\, being silly\, t
 he wit and repartee\, fear and bravery\, that goes with bringing fences cra
 shing down\, to the mockery of militarism. \nA woman's movement\, that conf
 licted and then embraced sexuality\, and stood up to the hateful press\, an
 d "respectable society"\, embracing freedom\, and our right to struggle aga
 inst the holocaust. \nIt is also a story of how women all over the country 
 embraced Greenham and supported the Greenham Women's Camps\, and some of th
 e triumphs and also  low ebbs of this anarchic protest. \n

DESCRIPTION:Many LGBT people like myself run from persecution to seek asylu
 m in nations like the UK thinking they'll immediately be safe. But most tim
 es seeking asylum makes you enter what feels like another form of persecuti
 on with having to prove your sexuality to the immigration system. When I as
 ked for asylum\, on many levels\, it felt like jumping from a frying pan in
 to a fire. In a series of such intrusive and embarrassing questions\, I was
  asked to prove I was gay. How on earth was I or anybody else supposed to d
 o that?!

DESCRIPTION:‘All The Nice Girls’ takes an entertaining glimpse at the lives
  of Gwen Farrar and Norah Blaney through the eyes of male impersonator Ella
  Shields. Starting out in Lena Ashwell’s concert parties for the troops in 
 WW1 the young Farrar and Blaney quickly adapted their classical ‘cello/pian
 o act into a ‘turn’ full of repartee and physical humour.\nHousehold names 
 in the early 1920s Farrar and Blaney had an on and offstage partnership\, s
 inging popular love songs of the day to each other in West End Revues and l
 iving together openly. Atthe same time Ella Shields’ Music Hall act was in 
 decline. ‘All The Nice Girls’ imagines her fictitious reaction to the young
 er pair as they live the starry life of Bright Young Things. Will their rel
 ationship survive the pressures of the age and the conflicting urges to mar
 ry and conform or to party wildly into oblivion?\nMore formal head shots an
 d productions photos can be provided shortly.\nAli Child is a writer\, dire
 ctor and performer. She was a Choral Exhibitioner at Trinity College\, Camb
 ridge\, appeared at the Arts Theatre with the Marlowe Society and Cambridge
  University Opera Society and  toured for two years with the Footlights Rev
 ue. She graduated with a degree in History and a P.G.C.E. in English and Dr
 ama.\n Rosie Wakley has worked in the theatre in many capacities including 
 Master Carpenter\, Stage Manager and ultimately Production Manager at the C
 oliseum for the English National Opera. She has an M.B.A. degree from Lanca
 ster University and performs widely as her alter ego\, lounge singer\, Ronn
 ie Rialto\n

DESCRIPTION:At the age of twenty-six\, Eva Gore-Booth was sent to recover f
 rom illness in the picturesque village of Bordighera in Italy. In the garde
 n\, standing under an olive tree\, she first met a young English woman\, Es
 ther Roper. The encounter was to change the two women’s lives forever.  \nE
 va Gore-Booth was the daughter of an Anglo-Irish landlord who owned one of 
 the largest estates in the West of Ireland. In stark contrast\, Esther Rope
 r was from working class stock. Within months of her return to Ireland\, Ev
 a made an extraordinary decision in order to be with Esther. In 1897\, she 
 rejected her aristocratic lifestyle\, moving from an opulent mansion in the
  beautiful countryside of Sligo to a mid-terrace property in the smog-bound
  quarters of industrial Manchester.\nThis talk examines the remarkable thir
 ty-year relationship of Eva and Esther. Once labelled as a pair of oddities
 \, it is now clear that the women were open about their relationship\, mixi
 ng with an eclectic group of radical gay and lesbian activists. The couple 
 became formidable political advocates in England often organising successfu
 l and radical campaigns for social justice. Using recently uncovered letter
 s\, diaries and manuscripts\, this story is a fascinating account of two wo
 men who refused to comply with the norms of society at the turn of the twen
 tieth century.\n\nDr Sonja Tiernan is a Lecturer in Modern History at Liver
 pool Hope University. She has published widely in the area of LGBT history 
 including two volumes on the histories of sexuality. Her most recent public
 ations include Eva Gore-Booth: an image of such politics (2012) and The Pol
 itical Writings of Eva Gore-Booth due for publication in 2015. Sonja is cur
 rently writing the official history of the Marriage Equality campaign in Ir
 eland to be published later this year.  \n

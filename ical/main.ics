DESCRIPTION:In the early 1800s there was a vibrant social and sexual scene 
 for men which revolved around the house of Isaac Hitchen in Great Sankey ne
 ar Warrington. Meeting places like this were known as ‘molly’ houses in the
  parlance of the day. In May of 1806 a large group of the men were arrested
  following a raid on the house. Some escaped\, but many of them were charge
 d with ‘sodomy’ or an ‘unnatural crime\,’ which in England carried the deat
 h penalty from the 1530s until 1861. In September of 1806\, five of the men
 \, including Hitchen himself\, were sentenced to death by hanging. There is
  a Preston based LGBT community project named in his memory. \n\n"Isaac Hit
 chen's House" tells the story of these men\, the investigation\, and the at
 titudes of the authorities\, in song. Written and performed by {Eleanor Lev
 in}\, {Nina George} and {Scott Millington} of the Grievous Angels as part o
 f Lancaster's 'Documenting Dissent' project led by Global Link with gratefu
 l acknowledgement to Harry Cocks\, Richard Norton and the Lancashire Archiv
 es.\n \nEleanor\, Nina and Scott’s first musical foray together was in 2005
  as part of ‘The Mistresses of the Ten Minute Musical’ and led them to be i
 nstrumental in the foundation of the Grievous Angels\, a solidarity-folk co
 llective which was based in Lancaster. They are currently working on a proj
 ect of songs based on Lancaster’s local history\, and developing their own 
 original works.  \n\n[Website of the song](http://www.documentingdissent.or

DESCRIPTION:Many LGBT people like myself run from persecution to seek asylu
 m in nations like the UK thinking they'll immediately be safe. But most tim
 es seeking asylum makes you enter what feels like another form of persecuti
 on with having to prove your sexuality to the immigration system. When I as
 ked for asylum\, on many levels\, it felt like jumping from a frying pan in
 to a fire. In a series of such intrusive and embarrassing questions\, I was
  asked to prove I was gay. How on earth was I or anybody else supposed to d

DESCRIPTION:At the age of twenty-six\, in 1896\, Eva Gore-Booth was sent to
  recover from illness in the picturesque village of Bordighera in Italy. In
  the garden\, standing under an olive tree\, she first met a young English 
 woman\, Esther Roper. The encounter was to change the two women’s lives for
 ever.  \n\nEva Gore-Booth was the daughter of an Anglo-Irish landlord who o
 wned one of the largest estates in the West of Ireland. In stark contrast\,
  Esther Roper was from working class stock. Within months of her return to 
 Ireland\, Eva made an extraordinary decision in order to be with Esther. In
  1897\, she rejected her aristocratic lifestyle\, moving from an opulent ma
 nsion in the beautiful countryside of Sligo to a mid-terrace property in th
 e smog-bound quarters of industrial Manchester.\n\nThis talk examines the r
 emarkable thirty-year relationship of Eva and Esther. Once labelled as a pa
 ir of oddities\, it is now clear that the women were open about their relat
 ionship\, mixing with an eclectic group of radical gay and lesbian activist
 s. The couple became formidable political advocates in England often organi
 sing successful and radical campaigns for social justice. Using recently un
 covered letters\, diaries and manuscripts\, this story is a fascinating acc
 ount of two women who refused to comply with the norms of society at the tu
 rn of the twentieth century.\n\n{Dr Sonja Tiernan} is a Lecturer in Modern 
 History at Liverpool Hope University. She has published widely in the area 
 of LGBT history including two volumes on the histories of sexuality. Her mo
 st recent publications include Eva Gore-Booth: an Image of Such Politics (2
 012) and The Political Writings of Eva Gore-Booth due for publication in 20
 15. Sonja is currently writing the official history of the Marriage Equalit
 y campaign in Ireland to be published later this year.  \n

DESCRIPTION:‘All The Nice Girls’ takes an entertaining glimpse at the lives
  of Gwen Farrar and Norah Blaney through the eyes of male impersonator Ella
  Shields. Starting out in Lena Ashwell’s concert parties for the troops in 
 WW1 the young Farrar and Blaney quickly adapted their classical ‘cello/pian
 o act into a ‘turn’ full of repartee and physical humour.\nHousehold names 
 in the early 1920s Farrar and Blaney had an on and offstage partnership\, s
 inging popular love songs of the day to each other in West End Revues and l
 iving together openly. Atthe same time Ella Shields’ Music Hall act was in 
 decline. ‘All The Nice Girls’ imagines her fictitious reaction to the young
 er pair as they live the starry life of Bright Young Things. Will their rel
 ationship survive the pressures of the age and the conflicting urges to mar
 ry and conform or to party wildly into oblivion?\n\nMore formal head shots 
 and productions photos can be provided shortly.\n{Ali Child} is a writer\, 
 director and performer. She was a Choral Exhibitioner at Trinity College\, 
 Cambridge\, appeared at the Arts Theatre with the Marlowe Society and Cambr
 idge University Opera Society and  toured for two years with the Footlights
  Revue. She graduated with a degree in History and a P.G.C.E. in English an
 d Drama.\n\n{Rosie Wakley} has worked in the theatre in many capacities inc
 luding Master Carpenter\, Stage Manager and ultimately Production Manager a
 t the Coliseum for the English National Opera. She has an M.B.A. degree fro

DESCRIPTION:{Sheila Standard} remembers where she was in 1979 when it was a
 nnounced on the radio that First Strike\, American Cruise Nuclear missiles 
 were to be based at Greenham Common USAF Airbase. Like most people she was 
 gripped with fear and a sense of inevitable disaster\, and felt powerless t
 o do anything. The worst bit was her mum lived near Greenham\, and would 'g
 et it first!' However\, the feeling of powerlessness did not last for long.
  All over the country people started to organise into anti missile groups\,
  and she joined Withington Against the Missiles\, a local group in Manchest
 er\, and accidentally got involved in an NVDA (Non Violent Direct Action) p
 rotest becoming one of the "Bunker 4". \n\nThen something truly epic happen
 ed... Greenham. \n\nThis is a very personal reflection of one of thousands 
 of women discovering the power of working together\, singing\, being silly\
 , the wit and repartee\, fear and bravery\, that goes with bringing fences 
 crashing down\, to the mockery of militarism. \n\nA women's movement that c
 onflicted and then embraced sexuality\, and stood up to the hateful press\,
  and "respectable society"\, embracing freedom\, and our right to struggle 
 against the holocaust. \n\nIt is also a story of how women all over the cou
 ntry embraced Greenham and supported the Greenham Women's Camps\, and some 
 of the triumphs and also low ebbs of this anarchic protest. \n

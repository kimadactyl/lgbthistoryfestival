DESCRIPTION:Sheila Standard remembers where she was in 1979 when it was ann
 ounced on the radio that First Strike\, American Cruise Nuclear missiles we
 re to be based at Greenham Common USAF Airbase. Like most people she was gr
 ipped with fear and a sense of inevitable disaster\, and felt powerless to 
 do anything. The worst bit was her mum lived near Greenham\, and would 'get
  it first!' However\, the feeling of powerlessness did not last for long. A
 ll over the country people started to organise into anti missile groups\, a
 nd she joined Withington Against the Missiles\, a local group in Manchester
 \, and accidentally got involved in an NVDA (Non Violent Direct Action) pro
 test becoming one of the "Bunker 4". \n\nThen something truly epic happened
 ... Greenham. \n\nThis is a very personal reflection of one of thousands of
  women discovering the power of working together\, singing\, being silly\, 
 the wit and repartee\, fear and bravery\, that goes with bringing fences cr
 ashing down\, to the mockery of militarism. \n\nA woman's movement\, that c
 onflicted and then embraced sexuality\, and stood up to the hateful press\,
  and "respectable society"\, embracing freedom\, and our right to struggle 
 against the holocaust. \n\nIt is also a story of how women all over the cou
 ntry embraced Greenham and supported the Greenham Women's Camps\, and some 
 of the triumphs and also  low ebbs of this anarchic protest. \n

DESCRIPTION:At the age of twenty-six\, Eva Gore-Booth was sent to recover f
 rom illness in the picturesque village of Bordighera in Italy. In the garde
 n\, standing under an olive tree\, she first met a young English woman\, Es
 ther Roper. The encounter was to change the two women’s lives forever.  \n\
 nEva Gore-Booth was the daughter of an Anglo-Irish landlord who owned one o
 f the largest estates in the West of Ireland. In stark contrast\, Esther Ro
 per was from working class stock. Within months of her return to Ireland\, 
 Eva made an extraordinary decision in order to be with Esther. In 1897\, sh
 e rejected her aristocratic lifestyle\, moving from an opulent mansion in t
 he beautiful countryside of Sligo to a mid-terrace property in the smog-bou
 nd quarters of industrial Manchester.\n\nThis talk examines the remarkable 
 thirty-year relationship of Eva and Esther. Once labelled as a pair of oddi
 ties\, it is now clear that the women were open about their relationship\, 
 mixing with an eclectic group of radical gay and lesbian activists. The cou
 ple became formidable political advocates in England often organising succe
 ssful and radical campaigns for social justice. Using recently uncovered le
 tters\, diaries and manuscripts\, this story is a fascinating account of tw
 o women who refused to comply with the norms of society at the turn of the 
 twentieth century.\n\nDr {Sonja Tiernan} is a Lecturer in Modern History at
  Liverpool Hope University. She has published widely in the area of LGBT hi
 story including two volumes on the histories of sexuality. Her most recent 
 publications include Eva Gore-Booth: an image of such politics (2012) and T
 he Political Writings of Eva Gore-Booth due for publication in 2015. Sonja 
 is currently writing the official history of the Marriage Equality campaign
  in Ireland to be published later this year.  \n

DESCRIPTION:In the early 1800s there was a vibrant social and sexual scene 
 for men which revolved around the house of Isaac Hitchen in Great Sankey ne
 ar Warrington. Meeting places like this were known as ‘molly’ houses in the
  parlance of the day. In May of 1806 a large group of the men were arrested
  following a raid on the house. Some escaped\, but many of them were charge
 d with ‘sodomy’ or an ‘unnatural crime\,’ which in England carried the deat
 h penalty from the 1530s until 1861. In September of 1806\, five of the men
 \, including Hitchen himself\, were sentenced to death by hanging. There is
  a Preston based LGBT community project named in his memory. \n\n"Isaac Hit
 chen's House" tells the story of these men\, the investigation\, and the at
 titudes of the authorities\, in song. Written and performed by {Eleanor Lev
 in}\, {Nina George} and {Scott Millington} of the Grievous Angels as part o
 f Lancaster's 'Documenting Dissent' project led by Global Link with gratefu
 l acknowledgement to Harry Cocks\, Richard Norton and the Lancashire Archiv
 es.\n \nEleanor\, Nina and Scott’s first musical foray together was in 2005
  as part of ‘The Mistresses of the Ten Minute Musical’ and led them to be i
 nstrumental in the foundation of the Grievous Angels\, a solidarity-folk co
 llective which was based in Lancaster. They are currently working on a proj
 ect of songs based on Lancaster’s local history\, and developing their own 
 original works.  \n\n[Website of the song](http://www.documentingdissent.or

DESCRIPTION:Many LGBT people like myself run from persecution to seek asylu
 m in nations like the UK thinking they'll immediately be safe. But most tim
 es seeking asylum makes you enter what feels like another form of persecuti
 on with having to prove your sexuality to the immigration system. When I as
 ked for asylum\, on many levels\, it felt like jumping from a frying pan in
 to a fire. In a series of such intrusive and embarrassing questions\, I was
  asked to prove I was gay. How on earth was I or anybody else supposed to d
 o that?!

DESCRIPTION:In the early 1800's there was a vibrant social and sexual scene
  for men which revolved around the house of Isaac Hitchen in Great Sankey n
 ear Warrington. Meeting places like this were known as ‘molly’ houses in th
 e parlance of the day. In May of 1806 a large group of the men were arreste
 d following a raid on the house. Some escaped\, but many of them were charg
 ed with ‘sodomy’ or an ‘unnatural crime\,’ which in England carried the dea
 th penalty from the 1530's until 1861. In September of 1806\, five of the m
 en\, including Hitchen himself\, were sentenced to death by hanging. There 
 is a Preston based LGBT community project named in his memory. \n\n"Isaac H
 itchen's House" tells the story of these men\, the investigation\, and the 
 attitudes of the authorities\, in song. Written and performed by Eleanor Le
 vin\, Nina George and Scott Millington of the Grievous Angels as part of La
 ncaster's 'Documenting Dissent' project led by Global Link with grateful ac
 knowledgement to Harry Cocks\, Richard Norton and the Lancashire Archives.\
 n \nEleanor\, Nina and Scott’s first musical foray together was in 2005 as 
 part of ‘The Mistresses of the Ten Minute Musical’ and led them to be instr
 umental in the foundation of the Grievous Angels\, a solidarity-folk collec
 tive which was based in Lancaster. They are currently working on a project 
 of songs based on Lancaster’s local history\, and developing their own orig
 inal works.  \n\n[Website address of the song](http://www.documentingdissen

DESCRIPTION:Talk by {Prossy Kakooza}: Many LGBT people like myself run from
  persecution to seek asylum in countries like UK thinking they'll immediate
 ly be safe. But most times seeking asylum makes you enter what feels like a
 nother form of persecution with having to prove your sexuality to the immig
 ration system. When I asked for asylum\, on many levels\, it felt like jump
 ing from a frying pan into a fire. In a series of such intrusive and embarr
 assing questions\, I was asked to prove I was gay. How on earth was I or an
 ybody else supposed to do that?!

DESCRIPTION:{Rose Bush} will share some of her riotous past with us in a pr
 esentation of this ongoing oral history project. \n\nThis talk will be a mi
 xture of audio interviews\, photographs and films of the period. \n\nBefore
  there were queer activists\, before there were Riot Grrls there were the R
 ebel Dykes of London. We were young\, we were feminists\, we were anarchist
 s\, we were punks. We lived together in squats in Hackney and Brixton and a
 t Greenham Camp (Green and Blue gates only). We went to political demos eve
 ry Saturday\, we created squatted crèches and bookshops and Wild Women Week
 ends (a forerunner of Ladyfests)\, feminist newspapers\, like Feminaxe and 
 magazines such as Shocking Pink. We had bands like Poison Girls and Well Oi
 led Sisters. We ran sex positive Lesbian S/M clubs such as Chain Reactions\
 , we were trans friendly\, we worked in the sex industry. We talked politic
 s. We fought\, we made up\, we created and we loved. \n\nRose Bush is Manch
 ester based promoter of queer events and she works as a nurse. Over the pas
 t 5 years in Manchester she has been involved with Ladyfests\, Queerchester
 \, Queer We Are and The Riot Collective. She’s going to be aged 50 very soo
 n\, and before living in Manchester she has moved around every few years\, 
 living in amongst other places\, San Francisco\, London\, Berlin\, Glasgow 
 and Todmorden\, always finding some feminist or queer project or other to i
 nspire her.\n\nRead her blog article [here](http://lgbthistoryfestival.org/

  15s only. \n

DESCRIPTION:{Peter Scott-Presland} will read from his forthcoming book\, _A
 miable Warriors_. \n\nThe Campaign for Homosexual Equality between 1967 and
  1973 developed a unique approach to the emancipation of homosexuals. The r
 eason for prejudice was ignorance\, and ignorance would only be dispelled i
 f heterosexual members of society came to know some real-life homosexuals. 
  So it was important for people to start coming out.  But they would never 
 be able to do that until they had discovered some self-awareness and self-c
 onfidence. In order to do that\, they needed\, in the words of the title of
  Volume 1 of Amiable Warriors\, A Space to Breathe.  Somewhere they could e
 xplore what it meant to be gay\, and to gain the acceptance and support of 
 other homosexuals.  Initially this was going to be through Esquire Clubs\, 
 but when these proved difficult to get off the ground\, the focus moved to 
 the idea that any group of gay people can carry around its own 'gay space'\
 , and local CHE groups were formed across the country - over 100 in total. 
  The readings will focus on aspects of creating this 'gay space': firstly\,
  a brief account of trying to get a club off the ground in Burnley\; and th
 en the antecedents of local groups - Albany Trust discussion groups 1964-67
  in London\, and heterosexual singles clubs around the country.  Followed b
 y questions from the audience.\n\nFor forty years {Peter Scott-Presland} ha
 s been involved in the LGBT rights movement\, as campaigner\, journalist\, 
 playwright and entertainer ('the Vera Lynn of the homosexual community'\, a
 s he was described in 1982). The founder director of first Consenting Adult
 s (1979-86) and then Homo Promos (1988 - present) Theatre Companies\, highl
 ights of his theatrical career include a series of Heath Plays (1981-85) de
 signed to be performed at midnight on Midsummer Night near the Hampstead He
 ath cruising ground\, the controversial 'Leather'\, which a brewery tried t
 o ban from its pub theatre (Finborough Arms\, 1989)\; and the musical 'La R
 onde'\, nominated for Best Musical 2012 in the off-West End awards.As a jou
 rnalist he worked for Gay News\, Gay Times\, Axiom and above all Capital Ga
 y (1981-88) where he won a reputation as a savagely funny columnist and rev
 iewer of the contemporary gay scene\, as well as being a reporter.  He is c
 urrently writing lyrics for the band 'Matyas and the Hybrid Mind'.\n\nHe wa
 s commissioned in 2010 to write the 'official' history of the Campaign for 
 Homosexual Equality.  Though lacking formal qualifications as a historian -
  he has an MA and BLitt from Oxford in English - he does have the advantage
  of knowing some of the people who were involved in the story he is describ
 ing.  He has an insider's view of what it was like to set up and run campai
 gns in the 1970s and 80s\;  and his journalistic abilities can animate a un
 ique story which has not to this day been told.\n\n[Read exctracts of Amiab

DESCRIPTION:Many LGBT people like myself ({Prossy Kakooza}) run from persec
 ution to seek asylum in nations like the UK thinking they'll immediately be
  safe. But most times seeking asylum makes you enter what feels like anothe
 r form of persecution with having to prove your sexuality to the immigratio
 n system. When I asked for asylum\, on many levels\, it felt like jumping f
 rom a frying pan into a fire. In a series of such intrusive and embarrassin
 g questions\, I was asked to prove I was gay. How on earth was I or anybody
  else supposed to do that?!

  Chorus (MLGC) was founded in 2000 and is the city's only LGBT community ch
 oir. With more than 80 members\, it is one of the biggest LGBT choirs in th
 e country. \n\nWe are a community choir and welcome LGBT people with a dive
 rse range of skills and abilities. We meet to rehearse\, socialise\, to giv
 e concerts and to perform at a range of events\, including civil partnershi
 ps and events promoted by other LGBT community groups and affiliated organi
 sations.\n\nTo this end we employ a professional choral teacher as our musi
 cal director and strive to the highest quality of music-making that we can 
 achieve.\n\nYou may have heard or read about MLGC from the Safe to Sing eve
 nt in November 2014\, where several other North West choirs joined with the
 m in Piccadilly Gardens to sing along in solidarity after they had sung on 
 the Metrolink tram system as a form of protest. \n\nThis action was prompte
 d by homophobic attacks on two young gay men which had taken place on the c
 ity centre tram network. The men had been singing songs from the musical "W
 icked". This event was nationally and internationally supported around the 
 world.\n

  identity and sexuality in pursuit of an answer to the question we all ask 
 at some point in our life: “What’s it all for?”\n \nThe world continues to 
 turn\, and attitudes towards gender\, sex and sexuality have undergone a se
 a change since my own adolescence in the race-and-class-conscious south Lon
 don of the 1970s. My personal thread of a journey has woven itself both bec
 ause\, and in spite\, of these epoch-making changes.\n \nAll the while\, Sp

DESCRIPTION:The UK's oldest extant bisexual organisation\, BiPhoria\, is ba
 sed in Manchester.  Its existence has been at times both thanks to\, and de
 spite\, the wider LGBT scene and culture in the city - giving Manchester a 
 reputation as both a centre of bisexual community and of biphobia. Bi Commu
 nity News editor Jen Yockney explores the group's story\, in the context of
  Manchester's sometimes LGbt culture\, and the wider bi movement in the UK 
 since 1981.\n\n\nJen Yockney is one of the most prominent bisexual activist
 s in the UK\, having worked on giving bi communities support and voice for 
 the past twenty years. She works across many levels: frontline support at t
 he UK's oldest bisexual support group\; publications and policy-making\; an
 d as a mentor reaching out to new volunteers to help bi groups and projects
  around the country blossom. \n

DESCRIPTION:At the age of twenty-six\, in 1896\, Eva Gore-Booth was sent to
  recover from illness in the picturesque village of Bordighera in Italy. In
  the garden\, standing under an olive tree\, she first met a young English 
 woman\, Esther Roper. The encounter was to change the two women’s lives for
 ever.  \n\nEva Gore-Booth was the daughter of an Anglo-Irish landlord who o
 wned one of the largest estates in the West of Ireland. In stark contrast\,
  Esther Roper was from working class stock. Within months of her return to 
 Ireland\, Eva made an extraordinary decision in order to be with Esther. In
  1897\, she rejected her aristocratic lifestyle\, moving from an opulent ma
 nsion in the beautiful countryside of Sligo to a mid-terrace property in th
 e smog-bound quarters of industrial Manchester.\n\nThis talk examines the r
 emarkable thirty-year relationship of Eva and Esther. Once labelled as a pa
 ir of oddities\, it is now clear that the women were open about their relat
 ionship\, mixing with an eclectic group of radical gay and lesbian activist
 s. The couple became formidable political advocates in England often organi
 sing successful and radical campaigns for social justice. Using recently un
 covered letters\, diaries and manuscripts\, this story is a fascinating acc
 ount of two women who refused to comply with the norms of society at the tu
 rn of the twentieth century.\n\nDr {Sonja Tiernan} is a Lecturer in Modern 
 History at Liverpool Hope University. She has published widely in the area 
 of LGBT history including two volumes on the histories of sexuality. Her mo
 st recent publications include Eva Gore-Booth: an Image of Such Politics (2
 012) and The Political Writings of Eva Gore-Booth due for publication in 20
 15. Sonja is currently writing the official history of the Marriage Equalit
 y campaign in Ireland to be published later this year.  \n

 nnounced on the radio that First Strike\, American Cruise Nuclear missiles 
 were to be based at Greenham Common USAF Airbase. Like most people she was 
 gripped with fear and a sense of inevitable disaster\, and felt powerless t
 o do anything. The worst bit was her mum lived near Greenham\, and would 'g
 et it first!' However\, the feeling of powerlessness did not last for long.
  All over the country people started to organise into anti missile groups\,
  and she joined Withington Against the Missiles\, a local group in Manchest
 er\, and accidentally got involved in an NVDA (Non Violent Direct Action) p
 rotest becoming one of the "Bunker 4". \n\nThen something truly epic happen
 ed... Greenham. \n\nThis is a very personal reflection of one of thousands 
 of women discovering the power of working together\, singing\, being silly\
 , the wit and repartee\, fear and bravery\, that goes with bringing fences 
 crashing down\, to the mockery of militarism. \n\nA women's movement that c
 onflicted and then embraced sexuality\, and stood up to the hateful press\,
  and "respectable society"\, embracing freedom\, and our right to struggle 
 against the holocaust. \n\nIt is also a story of how women all over the cou

 of the triumphs and also low ebbs of this anarchic protest. \n

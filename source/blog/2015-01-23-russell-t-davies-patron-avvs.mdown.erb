Man of the moment, Russell T Davies, writer of Cucumber, Queer as Folk and Doctor Who has been announced as a patron of **A Very Victorian Scandal**.  Russell said:

> It’s a delight and an honour to support these wonderful shows.  Three new gay dramas about Manchester and they’re not mine.  Hurrah!  You lucky people.

A Very Victorian Scandal (#AVVS) is a groundbreaking new theatre project, which will be performed at three sites over St Valentines Weekend 2015 in Manchester.  The pieces have been commissioned by LGBT History Month as part of their tenth anniversary celebrations from their first national writers in residence, Ric Brady and Stephen M Hornby.  Their writing and production is being supported by a grant from the Arts Council of England.

The project will recreate scenes from the biggest police raid of an LGBT venue in British history.  Manchester’s famous Victorian detective Jerome Caminada led the raid on an all-male fancy dress ball in Hulme and created a national sensation in a scandalised press and public. This was the UK’s Stonewall moment, and it happened in 1880. 

The theatrical project consists of three events that will happen across Manchester City Centre. All three events are free.

#### The Raid

**Friday 13th February 2015, 8pm, Via, Canal Street**  
Elements of the fancy dress ball will be recreated at Via, on Canal Street in a themed night of entertainment. Audiences can mingle with the fancy dress ball attendees, and watch them sing and dance to Music Hall tunes. The evening will climax with a spectacular police raid.  

*No tickets required - just turn up!*.

#### The Press

**Saturday 14th February 2015, 12.15pm, Manchester Central Library**  
An intimate performance takes a fresh look at the motives behind the police raid. Secrets and politics combine to make some men, and ruin others. Detective Caminada courts the press, but can he keep control of the story?

#### The Trial

**Sunday 15th February 2015, 1.00pm, People’s History Museum**  
The fate of the prisoners will be decided. Can they all maintain an oath of silence, or will one of speak out? And how can the prosecution secure convictions if a law hasn’t actually been broken?

Russell T Davies said:

> The whole thing seems so brave and so right - by exploring Manchester’s rich LGBT past, we can discover who we are, right now, and how we came to be.  I know Ric and Stephen are approaching the project with great vigour and huge imagination - they’re a powerhouse, getting amazing talent on board with great energy and joy.  I can’t recommend this project highly enough, I think it will be a cultural milestone for the North-West, and an inspiration for all ages.’

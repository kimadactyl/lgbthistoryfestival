For clarity, we'd actually want to add the ul tag to the layout, but this is to show it works in the demonstration.

<ul class="clearing-thumbs small-block-grid-1" data-clearing>
<%= lorem.paragraph %>

<%= inline_img(lorem.image('1300x1400'),lorem.sentence) %>

<%= lorem.paragraph %>

<%= inline_img(lorem.image('2000x1200'),lorem.sentence) %>
</ul>

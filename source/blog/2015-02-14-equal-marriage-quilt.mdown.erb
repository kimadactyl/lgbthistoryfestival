During the LGBT History Festival everyone can see the Sex-Sex Marriage quilt project celebrating the 396 Members of Parliament (MPs) that voted in favour of same sex marriage bill 2013. It’s on display in the People’s History Museum in Manchester until 27 February.

I have been working with a range of venues and groups to get the public involved in the project. These include People's History Museum, LGBT Youth North West, Museum of Liverpool, FACT, LGBT History Festival, Homotopia and Unity Theatre. The portraits have been collected together to form a political map of the UK and all the MPs constituencies.
The project was made possible through successfully competing against 12 finalists for one of three mirco-residencies with People's History Museum.
I had to propose a pitch to a museum and then get the public to vote for my idea. It was a tough competition because the other candidates had really strong project so it was incredible that the idea got public support.

I had a chance introduction to Joan Burnette who is a trustee of Liverpool Pride she helped me test the project in a community tent during pride next to another art organisation Purlesque. It was a fantastic day and I got loads on contributions which really helped kick start the project.     
Once I managed to secure a mirco-residency I had a week in the museum to deliver my project. Catherine O’Donnell, Play Your Part Engagement & Events Officer was incredibly accommodating and supportive during the entire project. I was able to explore their archive and dig up some great historic images which were eventually included in the quilt as well! There was several really interesting images which I didn’t end up using I encourage everyone to ask to see the archive because it is a fascinating space.


I used the week to get people visiting the museum to write decorative messages to the 254 MPs that did not vote for the bill.  People were asked to write messages of hope towards a more equal and tolerant future and these messages would be incorporated into the quilt to represent the 254 MPs that did not support the bill. These messages would fill the gaps in the political map so that all 650 consistencies were represented in the quilt.

The project was really successful; I met local people from various different backgrounds and lots of international visitors as well. I had a really positive response to the project and was even able to engage people who couldn’t visit in person by getting them to tweet in their messages and decorating the messages for them. During the residency Sue Sanders and Jeff Evans visited the museum to discuss 
People’s History Museum hosting the first ever National LGBT History Festival. They took a look and my project and invited me to become involved in working with them to help with the festival. After a future meeting with them I ended up getting so involved with their work that I ended up coordinating the Sunday event at People’s History Museum.
Once the residency was complete I also applied to Homotopia's artist development scheme Queercore. I was selected to take part in the Homtopia’s 2014 Festival.

Artistic Director Gary Everett helped find venues to take on the next part of my project. I wanted to get the public to decorate 396 hand drawn images of the MPs that voted in support of Same-Sex Marriage. I took images of the MPs from Google searches and made line drawing copies of each of the MPs. I found time to draws these images during free time like watching TV or traveling in a car or a train or even whilst I was in bed in order to get the 396 portraits drawn.

I worked with different groups to get the public to decorate hand drawn portraits of the MPs that voted in support of the same sex marriage bill.

Homotopia linked me with Unity theatre which was great fun as people were drinking and taking part with the project between performances being showcased for Homotopia.

Museum of Liverpool hosted several sessions for the public to decorate the hand drawn images. You can see a short video produced by Homotopia about my time at the museum.

Joan Burnette also invited me to deliver a workshop at FACT in Liverpool which had loads of students and a great space to deliver the workshop in. I was really impressed by the students taking part I was nervous that they wouldn’t be interested but they all had a go and some even did more than one contribution.

I was also invited to go down to the launch of LGBT history Month to give the public an opportunity to get involved. That was a crazy whirlwind of people in a very short amount of time. It was really nice to meet a real variety of different LGBT community groups in one space.

I also worked with different youth groups of LGBT Youth North West holding sessions in Wythenshaw and Stockport. I volunteer with the Stockport group and they were one of the reasons I was inspired to start the project in the first place. 
Eventually all 396 contributions were decorated. I then had the huge task of bring all these images together into a final layout. The sheer number of contribution meant I had to repeatedly check I had all the MPs created and decorated. It was a mammoth task and wouldn’t have been possible without the constant support of my partner. All the images were scanned into a computer and checks were made to check the locations and consistencies were actuate (I really hope they all are!).

I had to then collate them into panels as the digital files became ridiculously huge in order to print the images to the scale I wanted them. These images were then sent to digetex in Trafford to turn them into physical panels printed on Cotton Calico.

The printed panel were taken to Deborah Cunliffe of Source Unknown and being constructed together. Due to the sheer scale of the work and the lack of space in my tiny house it was great to use outside help to get the job done in time for the launch.

The completed quilt has now been constructed and will be shown for the first time at People’s History Museum as a part of the Sunday programme for the first National LGBT History Festival. I can’t wait for everyone who contributed to see the final project and I really hope they enjoy the outcome!

    - Rose Bush talks about documenting London's rebel dyke underground of the 1980s.
    - "We were neither second wave feminists... nor where we the Riot Grrrl movement that was yet to be born. We were instead something new and wild and raucous, focussed on direct action; our links were as much with anarchism and punk as they were with feminist theorists."

The LGBT History Festival has been an amazing spur for me to start a project I have been interested in somebody doing for years. Although I am neither a historian nor a film-maker, the callout for submissions made me decide to record some archive material and to make a short audio visual film.

I lived in London in the 1980’s in a lesbian feminist community that we rarely read about in feminist history books. We were neither second wave feminists, seemingly mainly interested in meetings and theories and political lesbianism, with its anti-sex rhetoric, nor where we yet the Riot Grrrl movement that was yet to be born. We were instead something new and wild and raucous, focussed on direct action; our links were as much with anarchism and punk as they were with feminist theorists.

But this history cannot be found in books or archives. We were too busy getting on with our lives to write the books and collect the archive. I have been railing about this gap to my more academic friends from those years online for ages: “somebody should write this book” I would say. I guess if nobody else is going to do it, it will have to be me!

So I set up a Facebook page: <%= link_to "“London Rebel Dykes of the 1980’s”", "https://www.facebook.com/groups/1485907714991739/"%> and made a plan. I went down to London over the weekend 21-22nd November, taking over the BFI Library for 2 days. As people came in I interviewed them and scanned the many of documents they brought with them. Photographs of girls in squats, and on marches, copies fanzines and of DIY flyers.  On the Saturday evening I held a focus group of memories with seven women who came along. What rich stories and memories I have collected! One of the interesting things that has emerged is that this group of women were all hugely involved with political action: squatting houses, women only occupations and living at Greenham Common, and all either attended or helped create the first lesbian S/M club, Chain Reaction, with its emphasis on art and sex and community, where there were jokey cabarets with  live fist fucking and sex on motorbikes. Sex and politics and leather jackets seem to be the themes from the interviews!

As  I want historians in the future to continue exploring this archive I am building links with the Lesbian Archive (held at the Glasgow Women’s Library) and the London Metropolitan University Archive, and my intention is to give all the submissions to them when I have finished making my film.

Now I have the hard work ahead. I have 6 hours of interviews to transcribe, and I’m teaching myself Audacity and Video Studio Pro X7 software so that I can edit it down. I’ve been studying documentary making, and oral history recording.  My first task is to create a short presentation of some of the themes for a presentation at <%=link_to "The Queer Forum", "https://www.facebook.com/events/1507730632821629/?fref=ts"%> on December 7th, and they onwards to create a 20 minute film of sound and images to be shown at the history festival in February 2015.

          %h3 LGBT History Month
          %p
            Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and Trans History Month celebrates the lives and achievements of the LGBT community. LGBT HM is celebrated in February in the UK but our work to challenge homophobia, biphobia and transphobia continues throughout the year. Education is especially important to achieving this so much of our work focuses on schools.

      %h3 Prof. Charles Upchurch
      %p
        Charles Upchurch received his Ph.D. in modern British history from Rutgers University (2003). Professor Upchurch’s research focuses on nineteenth-century British gender and social history, and his teaching fields include modern Britain, the British Empire, modern Europe, gender history, and the history of sexuality. 
      %p
        His book, Before Wilde: Sex Between Men in Britain’s Age of Reform (University of California Press, 2009), explores the ways in which class influenced the interpretation of same-sex desire in the period when the British state first began to police sex between men on a regular basis.
      %p
        Charles will be speaking at the academic conference at 6pm on Friday, and Archives+ at 4pm on Saturday.

There are **family-friendly** events for children and young adults on the Saturday and Sunday. The 2nd **&ldquo;What is and how to do LGBT history&rdquo;** conference runs in parallel at the **Lesbian and Gay Foundation**.

        Saturday explores 200+ years of LGBTQ identity, from when George III was on the throne to the present day. Activists, academics and campaigners behind groups such as the _Campaign for Homosexual Equality_, the _Lesbian Information Service_, and _Press for Change_ discuss their life work, legacy, successes, and regrets.

        #### Where are we now?

        A celebration of the remarkable work of LGBTQ campaigners living today. The _Campaign for Homosexual Equality_ are launching the first volume of their history, written by **Peter Scott-Presland**, while **Ross Burgess** talks about CHE's impact and legacy. **Christine Burns MBE**, key activist in _Press For Change_, whose work contributed to the _Gender Recognition Act 2004_, will talk about overcoming the challenges to document trans* history.
        
        We also talk to the people behind the frontline services that improved the lives of many, such as _Nottinghamshire Lesbian and Gay Switchboard_ (presented by **David Edgley**) and the controversial _Lesbian Information Service_ (presented by **Jan Bridget**). How do the people involved in these campaigns and services feel about their legacy today?

        Many other remarkable individuals will discuss their extraordinary lives, including **Peter Tatchell**, founder of the _Gay Liberation Front_; and **Alex Herrmann**, who will talk about his life as a gay man in socialist East Germany.

        Obviously as a Manchester festival we have to talk about music! **Abigail Ward**, founder of the _Manchester District Music Archive_ discusses her _Queer Noise_ collection of tickets and posters, including infamous clubnights from _Flesh_ (at the famous _Haçienda_) to _Club Brenda_.

        #### How did we get here?

        **Helena Whitbread** discusses **Anne Lister's** (1791–1840) coded diaries, which detail her scandalous liaisons with women. Between 1806 and 1840 she wrote prolifically, with a total output of 26 volumes containing 4 million words. As well as writing about her sex life and seduction techniques, she wrote about the weather, social and national events, and her own business interests as a wealthy landowner.

        Oscar Wilde's lover, Lord Alfred ‘Bosie’ Douglas was married to **Olive Custance**, a remarkable person in her own right. **Dr Sarah Parker** will discuss her new research about Olive's relationships with both men and women, and her life as a successful poet.

        #### Exporting Homophobia
        In the 1800s, the British Empire stretched across two thirds of the world, and Britain exported laws banning same-sex relations to its colonies. Human rights campaigner **Peter Tatchell** and **Prossy Kakooza**, a refugee who has rebuilt her life in the UK after experiencing abuse and torture in Uganda, discuss Britain's colonial legacy.

        **A Very Victorian Scandal** ([#AVVS](https://twitter.com/hashtag/AVVS)) is a groundbreaking immersive theatre project, being performed over the festival weekend. The project will recreate scenes from the biggest police raid on an LGBT event in British history. Manchester’s famous Victorian detective, **Jerome Caminada**, led the raid on an all-male fancy dress ball in Hulme and arrested forty-seven men. The subsequent press coverage caused an international sensation. **This was the UK’s Stonewall moment**, and it happened in 1880.

        A living recreation of the fancy dress ball. Mingle with the fancy dress ball attendees, learn a little about their lives, and watch them sing and dance to Music Hall tunes. A Victorian police raid will then rudely interrupt the evening's raucous events.

        A fresh take on the motives behind the police raid, in an intimate performance at Manchester Central Library. Secrets and politics combine to make some men, and ruin others. Caminada courts the press, but can he keep control of the story?

        Experience what it was like to be amongst the 47 prisoners, as we recreate the infamous trial using immersive theatre. You will watch your fate, and the fate of the other prisoners, be decided by the Chief Justice. Will all of the prisoners maintain their promise to remain silent, or will the fear of prison force someone to speak out?

      :markdown
        The LGF hosts _&ldquo;The 2nd What is &amp; How to DO LGBT History?&rdquo;_ conference, which seeks to place attitudes, experiences and identities in their historical context.

        Despite the increasing popular demand for "LGBT History" in Britain, the history of attitudes towards sex and gender diversity in the UK remains an underdeveloped field, especially in comparison with the advances that have been made in the United States. An important part of the 10th anniversary celebrations of LGBT History month is to lead and develop the growing discourse into past attitudes towards sex and gender diversity within the academy and among the general public.

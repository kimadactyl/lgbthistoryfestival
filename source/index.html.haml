          :markdown
            [Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and Trans History Month](http://lgbthistorymonth.org.uk/) celebrates the lives and achievements of the LGBT community. LGBT HM is celebrated in February in the UK, but our work to challenge homophobia, biphobia and transphobia continues throughout the year. Education is especially important to achieving this, so much of our work focuses on schools.

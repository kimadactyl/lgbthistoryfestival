        Manchester is hosting the first ever national festival focused on exploring, exposing, and discussing lesbian, gay, bisexual, and trans (LGBT) history. The Festival is over five days, and will be at Central Library's Archives+, the People's History Museum, and many venues throughout Manchester. We will be showcasing new popular research into LGBT history, and celebrate LGBT representation in film and comics with a German film retrospective and an open discussion about comic books. It is a sister event to The 2nd _What Is & How To Do LGBT History_ Research Conference, a free academic conference on LGBT history.

        More details about all the events will be released over the next few months!

      %h2 Film Festival
      %p 
        For the last century, films have played an important part in reconfiguring traditional notions of family and marriage; whilst at the same time, celebrating a diversity of sex and gender. As part of the First National Festival of LGBT History, the film circuit reflects upon the experiences of LGBT people, through the history of cinema; challenging heteronormativity and cultural under-representation. Through an exploration of people, their lives and their relationships, these films represent sexuality as unambiguously gay and unashamedly neither fixed nor conventional. The National Festival of LGBT History proudly promotes this intelligent, sensitive and humorous series of cinema contributions.

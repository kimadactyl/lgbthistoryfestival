        ## Main Venues

        All the festival venues are in central Manchester, within easy reach of public transport. If you're travelling from abroad, [Manchester has its own airport](http://www.manchesterairport.co.uk/) which is a 15 minute train journey or approximately Â£18 taxi journey from Manchester Piccadilly. We recommend [traintimes.org.uk](http://traintimes.org.uk/) as the best route planning website.

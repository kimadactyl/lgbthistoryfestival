      <h1>About the festival</h1>
      <p>
        Manchester is hosting the first ever national festival focused on exploring, exposing, and discussing lesbian, gay, bisexual, and trans (LGBT) history. The Festival is over five days, and will be at Central Library's Archives+, the People's History Museum, and many venues throughout Manchester. We will be showcasing new popular research into LGBT history, and celebrate LGBT representation in film and comics with a German film retrospective and an open discussion about comic books. It is a sister event to The 2nd What Is &amp; How To Do LGBT History Research Conference, a free academic conference on LGBT history.

      <h3>Why is this happening?</h3>
      <p>The introduction and promotion of LGBT History Month (UK) by Schools OUT in 2005 has significantly enhanced and further validated awareness of and interest in LGBT and Human Rights Campaigns of the second half of the 20th century. The associated and growing interest in 'LGBT History' has created a growing public demand for readings of that past, that has in turn encouraged popular and academic research into that past. However, despite the increasing popular demand for such history, it still an area of study that in the UK is very much in its infancy compared to the remarkable advances made elsewhere.</p>
      
      <p>In recognition of that growing historical interest and to further 'boost' the study of that past, Schools OUT in concert with other like-minded organisations and groups are launching this festival: <em>The National Festival of LGBT History</em>. The City of Manchester, the birth place of the original Homosexual/Human Rights campaign, is to play host to a events over the St. Valentine's Day Weekend. There are several Festival themes that deliberately seek to bring together and promote academic and popular scholarship of this important but neglected part of our common past. </p>
    </div>
    <div class='large-6 columns'>
      <h3>Festival Themes</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>Popularise the study, and hence a fuller understanding, of past attitudes towards sex and gender diversity within the academy and among the general public.</li>
        <li>Challenge the embedded ignorance (heteronormativity) within schools by facilitating and encouraging the teaching of a comprehensive and thereby less deterministic reading of the past.</li>
        <li>Encourage and promote research into past attitudes towards sex and gender diversity, especially those endeavours seeking to question the silences and bias within general historiography. The goal being the development a comprehensive indigenous history that further compliments the global reading of past attitudes towards sex and gender diversity.</li>
        <li>Encourage and promote the collection, archiving and utilisation of material that evidences that past. Without such material the expansion of research into this area of the past is seriously arrested.</li>
        <li>Seek to develop commercial partnerships to help address the growing public (and especially media) interest in past attitudes towards sex and gender diversity.</li>

      <h2>About the organisers</h2>
    </div>
    <div class='large-6 columns'>
      <h3>Schools OUT</h3>
      <p>Schools OUT is a membership based organisation – currently applying for charity status – that began life as The Gay Teachers' Association in 1974. Our overarching goal is to make our schools and educational institutions safe spaces for our LGBT communities as teachers, lecturers and trainers; as pupils and students; as parents; as teaching and learning support staff; as site-officers, catering and cleaning staff; and as headteachers, managers and governors. There is no other organisation that supports such a wide community in attaining such a wide, yet simple overarching goal.</p>
      
      <p>Our aims are:</p>
      
      <ul>
        <li>To provide both a formal and informal support network for all people who want to raise the issue of homophobia, biphobia, transphobia and heterosexism in education.</li>
        <li>To campaign on lesbian, gay, bisexual and trans issues as they affect education and those in education.</li>
        <li>To research, debate and stimulate curriculum development on LGBT issues.</li>
        <li>To work towards unison between teacher and lecturer unions and other professional stakeholders in education</li>
        <li>To promote equality, safety and visibility in education for LGBT people and all the protected characteristics.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <div class='large-6 columns'>
      <h3>LGBT History Month</h3>
      <p>As part of the educational remit of Schools OUT, Sue Sanders set up LGBT History Month in 2005 to celebrate the lives and achievements of the LGBT community. LGBT HM is celebrated in February in the UK, but our work to challenge homophobia, biphobia and transphobia continues throughout the year. Education is especially important to achieving this so much of our work focuses on schools.</p>
      
      <p>The overall aim of LGBT History month is to promote equality and diversity for the benefit of the public. This is done by: </p>
      
      <ul>
        <li>Increasing the visibility of lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (“LGBT”) people, their history, lives and their experiences in the curriculum and culture of educational and other institutions, and the wider community</li>
        <li>Raising awareness and advancing education on matters affecting the LGBT community</li>
        <li>Working to make educational and other institutions safe spaces for all LGBT communities</li>
        <li>Promoting the welfare of LGBT people, by ensuring that the education system recognises and enables LGBT people to achieve their full potential, so they contribute fully to society and lead fulfilled lives, thus benefiting society as a whole.</li>
      </ul>
      
      <p>There is however also much to do outside of schools and part of this Festival is to bring more awareness of our past to as many people as possible.</p>

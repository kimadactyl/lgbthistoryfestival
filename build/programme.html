            <p>Manchester is hosting the first ever national festival focused on exploring, exposing, and discussing lesbian, gay, bisexual, and trans (LGBT) history. The Festival is over five days, and will be at Central Library's Archives+, the People's History Museum, and many venues throughout Manchester. We will be showcasing new popular research into LGBT history, and celebrate LGBT representation in film and comics with a German film retrospective and an open discussion about comic books. It is a sister event to The 2nd <em>What Is &amp; How To Do LGBT History</em> Research Conference, a free academic conference on LGBT history.</p>
            
            <p>More details about all the events will be released over the next few months!</p>

            <h3>Saturday</h3>
            <p>
              On Saturday we are excited to take over part of Manchester Central Library and Archives+ to present new research by members of the public and historians. We will also be exploring the personal histories of some illustrious Talking Heads. For those who have not been, we are pleased to announce that the Archive will be open so that you can have a look at some of the collections. Experienced volunteers will talk about important collections and artefacts and why they have worked with these particular documents.
            </p>
            <p>
              We are also proud to make this event as accessible as possible and there will be a family friendly section of Central library where diversity and history lessons will be given by experienced teachers for Key Stages 1 &amp; 2. There will also be story time for younger children and teenagers. All books are available in the library.

The opening weekend of our <a href="http://www.phm.org.uk/whatson/election-britain-votes/">Election!</a> exhibition will provide the backdrop to finding out more about the political side of LGBT history, with talks, tours and the opportunity to delve into our archive.

              For the last century, films have played an important part in reconfiguring traditional notions of family and marriage; whilst at the same time, celebrating a diversity of sex and gender. As part of the First National Festival of LGBT History, the film circuit reflects upon the experiences of LGBT people, through the history of cinema; challenging heteronormativity and cultural under-representation. Through an exploration of people, their lives and their relationships, these films represent sexuality as unambiguously gay and unashamedly neither fixed nor conventional. The National Festival of LGBT History proudly promotes this intelligent, sensitive and humorous collection of films; as part of MMU’s cinema network ‘Seeing Queerly’ and hosted in a variety of Manchester’s finest venues.
